# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

## üìå Overview  
This project aims to predict customer churn (i.e., customers leaving) for a telecom company using real-world data. The goal is to identify which customers are at risk of leaving and what features contribute to that behavior.

## üìä Notebooks

### üîç 1. Data Exploration
- Data loading & cleaning
- Type conversion (`TotalCharges`)
- Missing value handling
- Statistical summaries & boxplots
- Category-wise churn visualizations
- Correlation matrix

### ü§ñ 2. Churn Prediction Model
- Train/test split (70/30)
- Preprocessing with ColumnTransformer
- Model training with RandomForestClassifier
- Evaluation: classification report, confusion matrix
- Feature importance chart

---

## üìà Results
- Model successfully predicts customer churn with reasonable accuracy.
- Most important features: `tenure`, `Contract`, `MonthlyCharges`, and services like `OnlineSecurity`.
